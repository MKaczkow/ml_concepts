# Wasserstein distance
* ... or, so called, `earth mover's distance` 
* is a distance metric between distributions, in given metric space
* if each distribution is a given amount of earth piled on given space M, the Wasserstein distance is a cost of turning one pile into the other
* cost is calculated as `amount of earth moved * mean distance moved`
